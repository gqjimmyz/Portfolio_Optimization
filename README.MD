# Portfolio Optimization – Exercises & Code (Palomar, 2025)

This repository contains my learning notes, code experiments, and exercise solutions based on **Daniel P. Palomar’s _Portfolio Optimization: Theory and Application_ (Cambridge University Press, 2025)**.

## Structure

- **code/** — Demo code adapted from the book or author’s public GitHub, annotated and run for personal learning.  
- **exercises/** — My own solutions and explorations for the book’s exercises and challenge problems.
- **data/** — Downloaded datasets for reproducibility (not included in version control if large or proprietary).

## Attribution

Some code examples in the `code/` folder are adapted from:
> [Portfolio Optimization Book GitHub repository](https://github.com/portfoliooptimizationbook)  
> Daniel P. Palomar and contributors, Cambridge University Press, 2025.

Exercise solutions, comments, and custom notebooks are my own work.
